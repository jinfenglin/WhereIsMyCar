# WhereIsMyCar
It is annoying to find your car after shopping at Macy, isn't it?
It is annoying after a party, you can't remember where you park your car, isn't it?
Bury something, and could not remember the location?
I want to develop a APP for iphone which could store the location you are currently at, and draw a path to the place user have marked.
The first version will:
- Record the outdoor location, where user marked.
- Draw path to the location.
- Use google map API
- Store some address

The following version:
- Try to record some 3D location, maybe somewhere inside a building. Like a store inside a mall, a product on a shelf of supermarket.
